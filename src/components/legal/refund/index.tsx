			<p>Last Updated: 9 September 2023</p>
			<p>
				At markai.co, we are committed to providing a unique and
				innovative experience through our AI-generated icons. We
				understand that AI, while powerful and revolutionary, isn&apos;t
				perfect and may not always produce the results you expect. We
				want you to be fully aware of this inherent risk before making
				any purchases.
			</p>
			<p>
				Due to the high costs involved in powering the advanced GPUs for
				our AI art generation, we unfortunately cannot offer refunds
				once credits have been used. We realize this may not be the
				ideal scenario for everyone, but this policy helps us to
				maintain a fair and sustainable service for all of our valued
				users.
			</p>
			<p>
				We strongly recommend exploring our community page before any
				purchase. You can see daily generated icons from other users
				which could help you understand the possibilities and
				limitations of AI art, and will hopefully guide your
				expectations. We believe in transparency and want you to make an
				informed decision about our unique service.
			</p>
			<p>
				Your understanding and support mean a lot to us. As we continue
				to improve and enhance our AI, we hope you will join us in this
				fascinating journey of digital creativity.
